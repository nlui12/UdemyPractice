Ask user to input integer that represnts number of cents
cents >= 0
1 dollar = 100 cents
1 quarter = 25 cents
1 dime = 10 cents
1 nickel = 5 cents
1 penny = 1 cents

pseudocode with test entry:

create int variable to hold user input
create 5 int variables to hold counts for each dollar, quarter, etc


print out ask user how many cents
user enters 64 cents

create int variable  remainder to hold remainder of each op

op1:
remainder = 64 % 100;
dollarCount = remainder/100;
//remainder = 64
//dollarCount = 0;

op2:
quarterCount = remainder/25;
remainder = 64 % 25 
//quarterCount = 2
// remainder = 14

op3: 
dimeCount = remainder/10;
remainder = 15 % 10
dimeCount = 1 
// remainder = 5

//repeat until pennies is reached
